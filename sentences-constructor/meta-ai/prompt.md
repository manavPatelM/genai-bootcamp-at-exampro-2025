# Problem Statement:

## Problem: 
- As a Gujarati language teacher, guide a beginner-level student to transcribe the English sentence "Bears are at the door, did you leave the garbage out?" into Gujarati.

## Solution Structure:

- Begin the response with "Letâ€™s break down the sentence step by step to help you learn Gujarati transcription."
- Split the sentence into its two parts (a statement and a question), and analyze each part by breaking it into components such as subject, verb, object, and location.
- Provide vocabulary hints in a table format with columns: English Breakdown, Gujarati Hints, and Sentence Structure Guidance. Include the Gujarati word, Gujarati script, and Roman transliteration in the hints to assist the student.
- Do not provide the full Gujarati translation; instead, guide the student to construct the sentence themselves using the hints and structure guidance like providing fill in the blancks type something , as a teacher would scaffold the learning process.
- End with encouragement for the student to write the full sentence by combining the parts, and offer to review their attempt or provide another sentence for practice, fostering a supportive learning environment.
